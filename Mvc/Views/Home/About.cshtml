            <h4 id="desc">I'm a pretty big Final Fantasy nerd. I have three versions of most of the games in the main series; the original release, the greatest hits release, and then the Japanese release as well. I also have most, if not all, of the strategy guides to go along with the games. I fell in love with the series at a young age and invested <strong>MANY</strong> hours playing and re-playing. The game has since been one of the fondest parts of my childhood. Eventually it lead me to other RPGs, including a text-based online game where I then fell in love with coding things. Then, boom! Years later, you have this.</h4>
