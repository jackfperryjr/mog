### Character propeteries

* Name (First and last, if they have one)
* Origin (The game they originated in)
* Race
* Gender
* Age
* Job
* Height
* Weight
* Picture
* Description (Sometimes short, sometimes lengthy)

If I wasn't able to find the data for the character a set of question marks (??) is substituted.<br>
This is a very simple data set only consisting of the games in the main series (1-15). Although, I'll look into supporting spin-offs as time permits. The data typically refers to the origin of the character, however, more info related to the character's other appearances is usually mentioned in the description.

### Monster properties

* Name
* Strength
* Weakness
* Picture
* Description

Currently there are very few monsters and very simplistic data. If you're interested in helping, let's talk!

### Game properties

* Title
* Release Date
* Picture
* Description

Titles are simple, just 01-15 as of now. Release date refers to the Japanese release, I believe. 

More documentation to come!
